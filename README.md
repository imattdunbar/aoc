# Advent of Code

I learned about Advent of Code in 2022, but eventually I will try and go back through the years and do them all if I have time.

## Running my code

Using bun now in 2023 for simplicity. [You can install bun here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) if you haven't yet, it's great for stuff like this!

```
bun start --year 2023 --question 1 --part a
```

### Happy Holidays!
