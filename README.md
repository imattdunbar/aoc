# Advent of Code

I learned about Advent of Code in 2022, but eventually I will try and go back through the years and do them all if I have time.

## Running my code

It's as simple as running `npm start`, but in `index.ts` you will have to change the `tsFile` to the correct problem you are trying to run the solution for.

Happy Holidays!
